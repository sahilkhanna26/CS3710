These are all the homework assignments for CS 3710: Introduction to Cybersecurity taught in the Spring 2023 semester by Prof. Aaron Bloomfield. The class was a general introduction to cybersecurity. The course content was split into six “modules”: introduction, ethics and policy, cryptography, networks, binary exploits, modern topics, and digital forensics. This class is no longer taught by Prof. Bloomfield which is why I am uploading my code. If you are a Prof. Bloomfield and would like this code removed, please email me at sk5xvh@virginia.edu and I will make this repository private.
