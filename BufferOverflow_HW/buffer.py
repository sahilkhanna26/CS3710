# This file is for part 5 of the buffer overflow homework at

#
# You just need to fill in the values shown below.  We are looking for candid
# answers, not sycophantic ones.

# What is your userid?  Just the mst3k part, please
userid = 'sk5xvh'

# What is your name?  This has to exactly match the name that is output by
# your program.  If you do not use your full name, which is fine, then put
# your name here as a comment.
name = "Sahil Khanna"

# Did you complete step 2 (writing the shell code)?  Making this True when you
# haven't completed it will not affect your grade, as this is for our
# internal statistics.
completed_step_2 = True

# Did you complete step 3 (overflow)?  Making this True when you
# haven't completed it will not affect your grade, as this is for our
# internal statistics.
completed_step_3 = True

# Did you complete step 4 (adding a newline)?  Making this True when you
# haven't completed it will not affect your grade, as this is for our
# internal statistics.
completed_step_4 = False

# Compared to other really hard CS assignments, such as CS 2150's hash lab,
# how hard was this assignment?

                               'I sat in OH for hours and worked on it for multiple days. It took over my life and I was so mentally strained because of this' \
                               'One of the hardest assignments I have done - it was so buggy and the TAs did not know how to help us either'

# Other than just giving the answers, what could we do to make this assignment
# run more smoothly in the future?
suggestions = 'Please provide more directions. Please have more office hours. Please do not make assignments that will mess up our week with how buggy, ambiguous they are. Also please give us more time. This homework was depressing and so tiresome.'

# Any additional information that you would like us to know?  Such as how far
# you got on a given task, etc.
additional_info = 'I did task 3 correctly with the setarch $(uname -m) -R -L ./grade < input.bin line in terminal. Using this line it will work. I was not able to get to task 4 with how buggy task 3 was and how many hours it took me. '
